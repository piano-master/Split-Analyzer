# Split-Analyzer
Take splits from LiveSplit and outputs textfiles listing the timesave for each split (one file lists splits in chronological order, the other lists splits in order from most timesave to least timesave).

How to use:
1. Download the split_analyzer folder
2. Open the splits on LiveSplit you want analyzed (Livesplit -> Edit Splits)
3. Click and drag over all the splits (do not include any images or column headers)
4. Ctrl-C (command-C on Mac) to copy the splits
5. Open a blank .txt file and press Ctrl-V
6. Save this textfile in the split_analyzer folder
7. Run the executable, type in the filename of the file you just created, press enter
8. Check the folder for two new textfiles: "splits_output.txt" and "splits_sorted_output.txt"
